# ytproj
This is a demo with youtube API, and OOP practice. Each API request type (video, playlist, channel) is defined as a class, and this provides a loose template for other API types not implemented yet. Other utility functions can also be implemented to get, for example, the number of subscriptions a channel has on youtube.
